Death Pepper: Scien!
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: Yes?
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: Has the second protype awakened it's Xuir Arts yet?
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: Not yet, sir.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: Then it's likely another failure.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: Prepare the new extraction room, I might as well get some
life energy from this.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: And who knows, the torture might awaken one of it's arts.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: Sir...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: Sir... I will not.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: You dare defy my orders?
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: I've worked at this research center for the past seven years,
but I can no longer handle this suffering.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: I will likely die, but atleast this will reduce the suffering
of others.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: ...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: I've suspected that you'd betray me.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: Don't think that I haven't noticed that the Forbidden
Ritual you had given was fake.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: You attempted the Forbidden Ritual of Nation!?
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: The only reason you're still alive is because of your
of your efficiency, though it seems that you'll no longer
cooperate with us.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: It's a shame that I'll have to kill you now, the only
other person that could replace you is Break, and let's say that I'm
not his biggest fan.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: ...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: It's been eight painful years since you destroyed my town for
the Forbidden Ritual...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: For these eight years, I've lacked the courage to stop the
pain, to not continue to work with you...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: I should have done this earlier, but it is something I can
no longer live with.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: Though it will not make up for my past actions, I will do
everything I can to save even one soul from this place.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
(Scien grabs a young child)
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: What do you think you're doing!?
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: If he stays here, he will die in three days when the
extraction finishes. With this, he will have a chance of
surival.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
(Scien activates a device)
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Death Pepper: BREAK! DEACTIVATE THE DEVICE!#units.DeathPepper.Portrait,units.Break.Portrait)
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:Break}
Break: The device seems to be malfunctioning...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:Break}
Death Pepper: Wait, does that mean...
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:Break}
Death Pepper: You fool! There's no way you'll survive with
a broken teleporter! Who knows where it'll take you.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:Break}
Death Pepper: You'll probably starve in the middle of the ocean.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper} {portrait_right:scien_big2}
Scien: If so, I will accept that fate as punishment.
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper}
(The teleporter activates and Scien disappears with the child)
==
{portrait_left:DeathPepper}
Death Pepper: They got away, what a waste of resources...
